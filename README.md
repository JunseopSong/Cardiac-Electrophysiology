# Multiscale models of cardiac electrophysiology
Single cell and tissue-level multiscale computational models of cardiac electrophysiology.
This repository includes atrial models (single cell, 1D cable, 2D tissue), sinus node models (single cell, 2D tissue), and myofibroblast models (single cell).
Additionally, phase singularity detection methods (Iyer-Gray, location-centric method) and intracardiac electrogram signal processing algorithms were implemented.
